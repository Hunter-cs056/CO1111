##OUR SECOND MEETING:
12/02/2026 Thursday 13:00pm
Participants: Maximos, Rania, Rudolf, George,Alexandra is missing
Location: Library
Topic: App functionality and Design
Discussions:
Maximos suggested the use of buttons instead of radio buttons when answering boolean
or Multiple Choice answers.The reason behind this is to make the app more convenient
to the user since radio buttons would require the user to tap once to select the answer
and tap again to submit it while the button tap will instantly submit the answer.This wil
be convenient to the mobile users who want to use the app with just 1 hand and answer questions
using their thumb.
Another topic discussed was if the share Location button should exist or a pop up
would just appear when the question requiring geolocation loads.In conclusion 
we kept share location as a button for user convenience(for example if the user
accidentally presses deny, page refresh is not a good option, while repressing
the button is more convenient)
