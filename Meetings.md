##OUR SECOND MEETING:
12/02/2026 Thursday 13:00pm
Participants: Maximos, R[Meetings.md](Meetings.md)ania, Rudolf, George,Alexandra is missing
Location: Library
Topic: App functionality and Design
Discussions:
Maximos suggested the use of buttons instead of radio buttons when answering boolean
or Multiple Choice answers.The reason behind this is to make the app more convenient
to the user since radio buttons would require the user to tap once to select the answer
and tap again to submit it while the button tap will instantly submit the answer.This wil
be convenient to the mobile users who want to use the app with just 1 hand and answer questions
using their thumb.
Another topic discussed was if the share Location button should exist or a pop up
would just appear when the question requiring geolocation loads.In conclusion 
we kept share location as a button for user convenience(for example if the user
accidentally presses deny, page refresh is not a good option, while repressing
the button is more convenient)

##OUR THIRD MEETING:
19/02/2026 Thursday 13:15pm
Participants: Maximos, Rania, Alex, Rudolf, George
Location: Library
Topic: App functionality and Design
Discussions:
1.Right now the app is using a random Player Name to call the API , Alex will have to create a Modal(pop-up text input)
in order for the user to enter a username. The username has to be valid and that is going to be checked by calling the /start API 
and checking just the errorMessages and status.ERROR.
2.Now The core gameplay is complete, all its left is for Rudolf to use the /leaderBoard API and create the leaderBoard
3.George will work to create a back to top button on the landing Page and add a back to homepage button on the app page and 
do a small research on the loading animations
4.Maximos will work to fix the score bug since the core gameplay is already done and try to improve the question loading 
for example making the input/Choice option disappear when the user presses submit. I will also work on fixing other bugs
involing the submit and skip button.Maximos will also work on applying cookies to our website
5.Rania will work on the class worksheet 18 in order to work on making our app downloadable on mobile and pc devices
